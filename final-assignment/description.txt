My site is a mock academic library site for an undergraduate university. 
To make it as fully fuctional as possible some of the pages that I did not create myself link to pages related to the college I work for.
Additionally, the hours that I embedded are sourced from my library's libguide. I tried to play with embedding more complicated widgets but 
I did not really understand the full API process needed to have the internal information show on an extrnal site. 

The site highlights the information that would be most helpful to a college student in the context of an academic library such as, hours, databases, 
finding books, and checkout policies, and study room policies. The site has not had text related to this content added already, but formats to
allow for easly addition. Lastly, he site links to ITS and tutoring support resources as those are departments that live in
our building, but manage their own digital resources.
